# Medical-Cost-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project covers a hands on coding walkthrough of the medical cost prediction project. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle and after cleaning the data, it is fed to various machine learning algorithms and cross validated to find the model that best fits the data and get the optimum results.
